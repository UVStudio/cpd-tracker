# Welcome to CPD Tracker by [Sheriff Consulting](https://sheriffconsulting.com/)

The project is current in hiatus. This codebase is a working prototype React-Native app. 
The purpose of this app is to help CPA's in Canada keep track of their verifiable and non-verifiable CPD hours.

The app calculates how many CPD hours a CPA needs in the current calendar year, based on how many CPD hours the CPA had 
obtained over the past 2 years prior, as provincial CPD rules mostly run on a 3 year rolling period.
